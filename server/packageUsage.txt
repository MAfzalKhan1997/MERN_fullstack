//// ____________SERVER SIDE____________ ////
concurrently ==> use to start backend and frontend server simultaneously

stripe ==> backend api handler modifies api handling process of stripe token(which is given by stripe-checkout library on frontend)

body-parser ==> Parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before handlers, available under the req.body property.
                    (post request dont accept paylaod so it will be available in handler through body-parser)

sendgrid ==> Email provider we are using in this project

heroku-postbuild ==> when we push code to heroku we guide it to install server dependencies after that install client dependencies
                        and make client side build that will be deployed to our server

***************** ***************** *****************

//// ____________CLIENT SIDE____________ ////
react-stripe-checkout ==> gives srtipe checkout process on frontend (a form handles user card details)
                            it gives token which we will forward it to the backend stripe api for confirming charge.
